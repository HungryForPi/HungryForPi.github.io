      Math contest things
    </h1>
    <p>
      I was a member of the NYC Math Team and the Stuyvesant High School math team,
      and am still involved with them.
      Among my math team-related activities are
      writing short articles on various topics (often to supplement lectures)
      and writing problems for math contests.

    <h2>
      Expository material
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
	<a type="application/pdf" href="./MathTeamDocs/InversionNotes.pdf">Notes on inversion</a>,
	based on lessons taught by Mr. Kats.
      </li>
      <li>
	<a type="application/pdf" href="./MathTeamDocs/GeomReview.pdf">A short review of Euclidean geometry</a>,
	taught to the senior math team class at the beginning of the school year.
      </li>
      <li>
	<a type="application/pdf" href="./MathTeamDocs/AssortedNT.pdf">Some intermediate-level number theory</a>,
	taught to the senior math team class at the beginning of the school year.
      </li>
      <li>
	<a type="application/pdf" href="./MathTeamDocs/Orders.pdf">Notes on orders in number theory</a>
	and their applications to contest problems.
	Featuring also Fermat's "Christmas theorem" on sums of two squares.
      </li>
      <li>
	<a type="application/pdf" href="./MathTeamDocs/pAdicNumbers.pdf">Notes on p-adic numbers</a>,
	taught to the senior math team class during the spring semester.
	Prominently focuses on rigorously defining p-adic numbers as
	metric completions of \(\mathbb Q\) endowed with the metric
	\(|x - y|_p\) induced by the p-adic absolute value.
	Also features a few words on Hensel's lemma.
	Uses much content from
	<a type="application/pdf" href="https://www.amazon.com/p-adic-Numbers-Introduction-Fernando-Gouv%C3%AAa/dp/3030472949">the book on p-adic numbers by Gouv&#234;a</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
	<a type="application/pdf" href="./MathTeamDocs/ModsFLT.pdf">Notes on modular arithmetic and the Euclidean algorithm</a>,
	taught to second-semester freshmen. Written with my friend Noam.
      </li>
      <li>
	<a type="application/pdf" href="./MathTeamDocs/IntegerPartitions.pdf">Notes on integer partitions</a>
	for a two-week sequence of lectures for the junior math team.
	Featuring several proofs of Euler's pentagonal number theorem
	and a combinatorial proof of the Jacobi triple product identity.
	Perhaps my favorite set of lecture notes to date.
      </li>
      <li>
	<a type="application/pdf" href="./MathTeamDocs/RealNumbers.pdf">Notes on the construction of \(\mathbb R\) with Dedekind cuts</a>,
	taught during a Mu Alpha Theta meeting.
      </li>
      <li>
	<a type="application/pdf" href="./MathTeamDocs/PermutationPuzzles.pdf">Notes on permutation puzzles</a>,
	taught during a Mu Alpha Theta meeting.
	Derives an algorithm to solve the
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle">15-Puzzle</a>.
	One should come away with a general idea of how to solve such puzzles,
	including even the much more complex Rubik's cube!
      </li>
      <li>
	<a type="application/pdf" href="./MathTeamDocs/SchursThm.pdf">Notes on Schur's theorem</a>,
	which says that if the positive integers are colored with
	finitely many colors, then there exist three positive integers
	\(x\), \(y\), \(z\), all of the same color, for which \(x+y=z\).
	Taught to the senior math team as a guest lecture in Fall 2024.

      Contest writing
    </h2>
    <p>
      The New York City Team Contest (NYCTC) is a 30-problem, two-hour long
      marathon style contest, where teams of four are given two problems at a time
      and receive a new problem each time they submit one.
      The contest happens at the end of each semester
      and is written by the NYC Math Team's top students;
      it is a highly anticipated event each time
      and in recent years has had over 100 competitors across the city!
      I had the privilege of writing the NYCTCs during my senior year.
      The NYC Math Team website has an
      <a href="https://www.nycmathteam.org/archive/nyctc/">archive</a>
      of previous contests, but my two contests are also linked below.

	and
	<a type="application/pdf" href="./MathTeamDocs/NYCTCF2023_sols.pdf">solutions</a>
	for the Fall 2023 iteration of the NYCTC
	(unfortunately, the leaderboard link is lost to time).

      The NYC Interscholastic Math League (NYCIML) is a contest
      organized and written by NYC Math Team alumni.
      Each contest consists of three pairs of two problems each,
      and contestants are given 10 minutes per pair of problems.
      During the 2024-25 school year, I wrote problems for the Senior A division,
      which is the upper division among the two senior divisions;
      the contests which I contributed to are below.
      The NYCIML website has an
      <a href="https://www.nyciml.org/free-past-contests">archive</a>
      of past contests.

    <h1>
      Math contest things
    </h1>
    <p>
      I was a member of the NYC Math Team and the Stuyvesant High School math team,
      and am still involved with them.
      Among my activities as a math team student were
      writing short articles on various topics
      and writing problems for math contests.

    <h2>
      Expository material
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
	<a type="application/pdf" href="./MathTeamDocs/InversionNotes.pdf">Notes on inversion</a>,
	based on lessons taught by Mr. Kats.
      </li>
      <li>
	<a type="application/pdf" href="./MathTeamDocs/GeomReview.pdf">A short review of Euclidean geometry</a>,
	taught to the senior math team class at the beginning of the school year.
      </li>
      <li>
	<a type="application/pdf" href="./MathTeamDocs/AssortedNT.pdf">Some intermediate-level number theory</a>,
	taught to the senior math team class at the beginning of the school year.
      </li>
      <li>
	<a type="application/pdf" href="./MathTeamDocs/Orders.pdf">Notes on orders in number theory</a>
	and their applications to contest problems.
	Featuring also Fermat's "Christmas theorem" on sums of two squares.
      </li>
      <li>
	<a type="application/pdf" href="./MathTeamDocs/pAdicNumbers.pdf">Notes on p-adic numbers</a>,
	taught to the senior math team class during the spring semester.
	Prominently focuses on rigorously defining p-adic numbers as
	metric completions of \(\mathbb Q\) endowed with the metric
	\(|x - y|_p\) induced by the p-adic absolute value.
	Also features a few words on Hensel's lemma.
	Uses much content from
	<a type="application/pdf" href="https://www.amazon.com/p-adic-Numbers-Introduction-Fernando-Gouv%C3%AAa/dp/3030472949">the book on p-adic numbers by Gouv&#234;a</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
	<a type="application/pdf" href="./MathTeamDocs/ModsFLT.pdf">Notes on modular arithmetic and the Euclidean algorithm</a>,
	taught to second-semester freshmen. Written with my friend Noam.
      </li>
      <li>
	<a type="application/pdf" href="./MathTeamDocs/IntegerPartitions.pdf">Notes on integer partitions</a>
	for a two-week sequence of lectures for the junior math team.
	Featuring several proofs of Euler's pentagonal number theorem
	and a combinatorial proof of the Jacobi triple product identity.
	Perhaps my favorite set of lecture notes to date.
      </li>
      <li>
	<a type="application/pdf" href="./MathTeamDocs/RealNumbers.pdf">Notes on the construction of \(\mathbb R\) with Dedekind cuts</a>,
	taught during a Mu Alpha Theta meeting.
      </li>
      <li>
	<a type="application/pdf" href="./MathTeamDocs/PermutationPuzzles.pdf">Notes on permutation puzzles</a>,
	taught during a Mu Alpha Theta meeting.
	Derives an algorithm to solve the
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle">15-Puzzle</a>.
	One should come away with a general idea of how to solve such puzzles,
	including even the much more complex Rubik's cube!
      </li>
      <li>
	<a type="application/pdf" href="./MathTeamDocs/SchursThm.pdf">Notes on Schur's theorem</a>,
	which says that if the positive integers are colored with
	finitely many colors, then there exist three positive integers
	\(x\), \(y\), \(z\), all of the same color, for which \(x+y=z\).
	Taught to the senior math team as a guest lecture in Fall 2024.
